# Sorting Algorithms
It contains all sorting algorithms and related problems.

## Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.

### Time Complexity
* Worst Case: O(n^2)
* Best Case: O(n) - If array is already sorted.

### Space Complexity
* Auxiliary Space: O(1)

## Selection Sort
The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.\The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.

* The subarray which is already sorted.
* Remaining subarray which is unsorted.

### Time Complexity
* Worst Case:  O(n^2) as there are two nested loops.
* Best Case: O(n^2)

### Space Complexity
* Auxiliary Space: O(1)
